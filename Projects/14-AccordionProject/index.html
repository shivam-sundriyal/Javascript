            <div class="text">
                C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne
                Stroustrup. First
                released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over
                time; as of
                1997 C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level
                memory
                manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
                compilers, including
                the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM
